Desciption:
Algorithm(s) Used :
⚫  Logistic Regression: A statistical method for binary classificationthat 
models the probability of class membership using a sigmoid function     
⚫ Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm that 
finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes by maximizing the margin 
between data points of different categories. 
⚫ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, non-parametric algorithm that 
classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors. 
⚫ Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple 
decision trees and combines their outputs for more accurate and robust 
predictions. 
⚫ Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-based model that splits data into subsets 
based on feature values, making sequential decisions to classify data points. 
⚫ XGBoost Classifier: An efficient gradient boosting algorithm that 
optimizes decision trees iteratively to improve accuracy and handle large 
datasets effectively.
